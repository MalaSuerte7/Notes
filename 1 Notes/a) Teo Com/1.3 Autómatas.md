### 1.3.1 Mathematical terminology  
##### Sets and how to write them:
- Group of objects represented as a unit.  
- Contain any type of object including numbers, symbols, and even other sets.
- Object in a set are called <span style="color:#ff8000">elements</span> or <span style="color:#ff8000">members</span>. 
- Infinite sets contains infinitely many elements. We write them by using "..."" .
- Type of sets: 
	- Singleton set: Just one member ( {2}  or { } or {1}  )
	- Unordered pair: Set with 2 members. 
- Write according a rule →  {n | rule about n}
- A sequence of k elements is a k-tuple. 3-tuple (7 , 21 , 57).
- F is a function with domain D and range R is f: D → R.

### 1.3.2 Finite Automaton 
 Let define it formal as a set of states and rules for going from one state to another, depending on the input symbol. Formally it's consider a list of those five objects: set of states, input alphabet, rules for moving, start state and accept states. In math a list of 5 elements is a 5-tuple.
 → **Transition function** : Define the rules for moving. Example: 
 If finite automation has an arrow from a state x to a state y labeled with the inputs symbol 1, that means that if the automation is in state x when it reads a 1, it then moves to state y. And we indicate it as  $\delta (x,1) = y$. 
 So this is the formal way to denotate a finite automata.

Let's go for an example: 
![[Pasted image 20230818101550.png | center | 400]]

That is M2 and in formal description it's $M_{2}$  is $(\{q1,q2\} , \{0,1\} , \delta , q_{1}, \{q_{2}\})$ .
$\delta$ es: 

__   | 0 | 1 
:---: | :---: | :---: 
q1 | q1 | q2 
q2 | q1 | q2 
Now we realized that $M_{2}$ accept every string that end in a 1. Thus $L(M_{2}) = \{ \ w \ | \ w\ ends\ in\ a\ 1\}$ .
Any ways in another examples, if it's the case that the start state is also the accept state u can write something like $L(M_{3}) = \{ w \ | \ w \ is \ the \ empty \ string \ \epsilon \ or \ ends \ in \ a \ 0 \}$. Just to make it clear, in this case every string that ends in 0 was accepted.
